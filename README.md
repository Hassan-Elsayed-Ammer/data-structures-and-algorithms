## Introduction
Data structures and algorithms are two essential concepts in computer science and programming.
Data structures refer to the way we organize and store data in a computer program. They are used to manage and manipulate data efficiently. Some common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
Algorithms, on the other hand, are a set of steps or instructions that are followed to solve a problem. Algorithms can range from simple to complex, depending on the problem being solved. Some common algorithms include searching, sorting, and traversal algorithms. By choosing the right data structure and algorithm, programmers can write efficient and effective code that solves complex problems.
